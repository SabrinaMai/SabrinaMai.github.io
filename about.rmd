Hello, my name is Sabrina Mai Nielsen and I am a PhD student within Biostatistics and Clinical Epidemiology Fellow at the University of Southern Denmark. I am co-affiliated with the Musculoskeletal Statistics Unit at the Parker Institute in Copenhagen, and The Rheumatology Research Unit, Department of Rheumatology, Odense University Hospital and University of Southern Denmark.
I am enthusiastic about using R and enjoy making pretty graphs â€“ with this page I hope to provide easy access to a variety of ready-to-use R codes for graphs.
